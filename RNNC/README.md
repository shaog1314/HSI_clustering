This repository contains: 

* Supplementary Material containing a gentle introduction to recurrent neural networks and visualizations of the Houston segmentations.
* **code**, being a directory contaning our implementation of the RNNs and VAEs presented in the paper 
* **1d-cnn_models**, being a directory containing the definitions of the 1D-CNN models
